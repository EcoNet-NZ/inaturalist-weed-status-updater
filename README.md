# iNaturalist Weed Status Updater

## Overview
The **iNaturalist Weed Status Updater** is a user-friendly web app that helps users update weed status on iNaturalist effectively. It enables users to add other user's observations to the [Weed Management Aotearoa NZ](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/weed-management-aotearoa-nz) iNaturalist project and update observation fields on their observations. This is not possible with the iNaturalist mobile app and is clunky to achieve through the iNaturalist website.

While it has been developed for use with EcoNet's [CAMS](https://econet.nz/our-projects/) Weeds Map, it is more widely applicable for any system storing weed data in Aotearoa/New Zealand using iNaturalist, or could be modified for other use cases to update iNaturalist via the API.

## How it works
The user authenticates using their iNaturalist credentials. The authenticated user is then authorised to update the observation. The **iNaturalist Weed Status Updater** prompts the user for the weed status and details, then adds the selected observation to the [Weed Management Aotearoa NZ](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/weed-management-aotearoa-nz) iNaturalist project and sets the observation field values using the supplied weed status and details.

## Key Features
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Ensures secure access to iNaturalist accounts. iNaturalist stores user details with the updated observation fields.
- **iNaturalist API Integration**: Modifies observation fields, such as weed control status, directly from the web app.
- **Serverless implementation**: The solution uses Azure static web app and function app serverless components, so is hosted at minimal (if any) cost and requires minimal maintainence.

## User Interaction View
This image shows how the updater integrates with **CAMS**. Other weed management systems can adopt similar workflows.

1. The [**iNaturalist to CAMS synchroniser**](https://github.com/EcoNet-NZ/inaturalist-to-cams) automatically updates the **CAMS** Weeds Map hourly with any new or modfied observations of interest.

2. Clicking on an iNaturalist-sourced weed instance on the **CAMS** Weeds Map shows an "Update weed status" button on the pop-up menu.

3. Once the "Update weed status" button is clicked, the **CAMS** application calls the iNaturalist application through the **iNaturalist Weed Status Updater**, which authorises the user to update the weed status. Where the user is not authenticated, iNaturalist prompts the user to authenticate with their credentials. 

4. The **iNaturalist Weed Status Updater** web form is then displayed allowing the user to set the weed status and details. Once changes are made to the fields, the user clicks on the "Update Observation" button which then adds the weed instance to the **Weed Management Aotearoa NZ** project and updates the relevant iNaturalist observation fields as the logged-in iNaturalist user.

## System View

The user is authenticated using iNaturalist's [OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference#auth).

After logging in, if required, the Authorization Code Flow redirects the user to the web app, a VueJS app deployed as an Azure Static Web App. This app calls a Python based Azure Serverless Function App which updates iNaturalist. 

This flow is shown in the following sequence diagram:

```

Here's a description of the numbered steps on this sequence diagram:
1. The user selects a Weed Instance on the **CAMS** Weeds Map (running on ArcGIS Field Map or Experience Builder).
2. If the Weed Instance was sourced from iNaturalist (using the [iNaturalist to CAMS synchroniser](https://github.com/EcoNet-NZ/inaturalist-to-cams)), the pop-up shows the "Update Weed Status" button. 
3. When the user clicks on this button, it performs a GET request to the **iNaturalist OAuth2 endpoint** with hardcoded `client id` and `redirect uri` parameters plus a `state` parameter containing the iNaturalist `observation id` of the Weed Instance.
4. iNaturalist determines whether a new login is required. If so, iNaturalist returns the login page HTML. If not, jump to step 8.
5. The iNaturalist login page is displayed on the browser.
6. The user enters their username and password (assumed to be valid for this flow, otherwise an error is displayed and the flow stops).
7. On submitting the username and password, the request is submitted as a `POST` method call to iNaturalist.
8. iNaturalist redirects the user to the **iNaturalist Weed Status Updater web app**, through the `redirect_uri` parameter passed in step 3. The redirect parameters includes a `authorization code` generated by iNaturalist and a `state` token containing the observation id (passed in step 3). These two parameters are read in the `created: function()` of `App.vue`. The `App.vue` file also contains a template of the user interface with the header, visit `date` field and an `iNaturalistUpdater` component for each of the potential states (Contolled, Alive, Dead or Duplicate).
9. The web app returns the Weed Status Updater HTML page.
10. The browser displays the Weed Status Updater.
11. The user selects the action to update the weed status (eg Controlled, Alive, Dead, Duplicate), fills in relevant fields and clicks on the `Update Observation` button (defined in `./components/iNaturalistUpdater.vue`).
12. This event calls the `updateObservation()` method which `POST`s the authorization code,  observation id and updated observation field data to the **Function App** (at `/api/update`). This calls the `update()` method in `function_app.py`.
13. The Function App reads the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and REDIRECT_URI from the Azure environment variables.
14. The Function App POSTs these variables and the authorization code to the iNaturalist OAuth2 endpoint.
15. The iNaturalist OAuth2 endpoint responds with the access token.
16. The Function App POSTs the access token, observation id and **Weed Management Aotearoa NZ** project to the **iNaturalist API** `project_observations` endpoint to add the observation to this project.
17. iNaturalist responds with a response code.
18. For each observation field value, the Function App POSTs the access token, observation id, observation field id and the observation field value to the **iNaturalist API** `observation_field_values` endpoint.
19. iNaturalist responds with a response code (for each observation field value call).
20. If any of these calls results in a **500** error response, the flow stops immediately. The Function App returns an error response code to the web page.
21. If all of the calls result in a **200 OK** response, the Function App returns a success response to the web page.
22. The web page displays either a success or failure message to the user dependent on which of the above two steps was executed.

## Creating your own custom iNaturalist updater
Should you wish to clone and modify this project, you'll also need to:

### Set up iNaturalist application
* Seek and obtain the right to create an [iNaturalist application](https://www.inaturalist.org/oauth/applications/new). In addition to filling out the form, your iNaturalist account must be at least 2 months old and you must have made at least 10 improving identifications over the last month. *I found I needed to add an identification of a finer rank of Order towards improving other user's observations (not your own).*
* Once your request is approved, you can create the [iNaturalist application](https://www.inaturalist.org/oauth/applications/new). You'll want to add a placeholder for the Redirect URI until the web app is created. This can be updated later. Ensure you check âœ… the **CONFIDENTIAL** box (assuming you're storing the credentials securely, eg as Azure environment variables).
* Store the client **ID** and **Secret** variables securely as the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables on your machine, so you can try out the code locally. You'll also need to store these as Azure environment variables.

### Set up Azure account
* Create an Azure account. These exercises are useful for learning about Azure Static Web Apps and Function Apps:
    * [Publish a **Vue** JavaScript app with Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/)
    * [Publish an API to Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/publish-static-web-app-api-preview-url/)
    
* Create a new Azure Static Web App to use for your application.

* Set up the environment variables for the iNaturalist `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` obtained from iNaturalist (above) and the `REDIRECT_URI` environment variable to the external URL of the Static Web App (e.g. `https://[unique-id].azurestaticapps.net`). Follow the link on [how to set environment variables in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/application-settings).

### Set the redirect uri on the iNaturalist application
* Edit the iNaturalist application and update the redirect URI to the external URL of the Static Web App (e.g. `https://[unique-id].azurestaticapps.net`).

### Copy this GitHub project and develop your application
* You'll need to merge the code in this project with the `.github/workflows` workflow from the newly created Azure Static Web App.
* Update the code as required.
* Creating a pull request on GitHub will generate a staging version of your app enabling a preview version of your site before publishing it. It won't be fully hooked up to iNaturalist since we have used the production URL as the redirect URI.
* Merging the pull request into your main branch will deploy the updated app to your production URL.

### Construct a URL to call your application
Construct the URL to start the flow at step 3 of the sequence diagram above. Given the `<client id>` from iNaturalist, the encoded URL (i.e. `https://` replaced with `https%3A%2F%2F`) of the Static Web App as `<redirect uri>` and the `<observation id>` of the observation you want to update, the URL will be:
`https://www.inaturalist.org/oauth/authorize?client_id=<client id>&redirect_uri=<redirect uri>&response_type=code&state=<observation id>`

## Hints
* `App.vue` contains the web app entry point and template, which then includes `iNaturalistUpdater` components.
* In addition to the component layout, `iNaturalistUpdater.vue` also defines the Observation Field Values that are to be updated as well as options for dropdown values, validation logic etc.
* Assuming you're only updating observation fields, you shouldn't need to change `function_app.py`.
